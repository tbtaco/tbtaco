Hi, my name is Tyer Richey.  I have a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering and minors in Computer Science and Physics from Kansas State University.

This is my personal Git where I'll be saving all of my future projects.  Feel free to look around.

If you're here wanting to see good examples of my coding ability, I would start with [LeetCode Practice](https://github.com/tbtaco/Practice)

Questions over anything are welcome at tyler.richey.777@gmail.com (professional) or at tbtaco@hotmail.com (main)
