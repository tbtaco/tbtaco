Hi, my name is Tyer Richey.  I have a BS in Computer Engineering from K-State and minors in Physics and Computer Science.

This is my personal Git where I'll be saving all of my future projects.  Feel free to look around.

If you're here wanting to see good examples of my coding ability, I would start with [LeetCode Practice](github.com/tbtaco/Practice/)

Questions over anything are welcome at tyler.richey.777@gmail.com (professional) or at tbtaco@hotmail.com (main)
